## Phase 1: Foundation — COMPLETE

All 6 steps implemented.

### 1.1 Project Scaffolding
- Vitest, Playwright, Prettier configs
- PWA manifest, directory structure, npm scripts
- `.env.example` with all environment variables

### 1.2 Database Setup
- 12 Supabase migrations (users, client_profiles, exercises, programs, program_exercises, program_assignments, exercise_progress, payments, reviews, testimonials, notifications + RLS)
- TypeScript types in `types/database.ts`
- Supabase clients (browser, server, service-role) in `lib/supabase.ts`
- Data access layer: 10 files in `lib/db/`

- Stripe checkout session creation → hosted checkout → webhook
- Webhook creates payment record + program assignment
- GoHighLevel CRM sync on purchase
- Success page with "Start Training" CTA
- Admin payments dashboard with revenue metrics

**Purchase Flow:**
```
/programs → /programs/[id] → "Buy Now" → Stripe Checkout
  → Webhook: createPayment() + createAssignment()
  → /programs/success → /client/workouts
```

### 2.3 Program Builder
- Admin program form with split type, periodization, AI generation params
- Exercise scheduling by day/week with sets, reps, rest, RPE target, intensity %, tempo, group tags
- Drag-and-drop exercise ordering

### 2.4 Client Registration & Dashboard
- Registration with email verification (Resend)
- Forgot/reset password flow
- Client dashboard with stats overview
- Profile editing
- Welcome email after verification

### 2.5 Client Questionnaire (Static)
- 8-step linear form: goals, fitness level, training history, injuries, equipment, schedule, preferences, review
- Saves to `client_profiles` table
- Admin can view responses on client detail page
- Pre-fills if client already has a profile

### 2.6 AI Exercise Assignment Engine
- 4-agent Claude Sonnet pipeline:
  - Agent 1: Profile Analyzer (recommended split, volume targets, constraints)
  - Agent 2: Program Architect (program skeleton with weeks/days/slots)
  - Agent 3: Exercise Selector (assigns specific exercises to slots)
  - Agent 4: Validation (checks equipment, injury, difficulty, balance)
- Retry loop (max 2x) if validation fails
- Admin "AI Generate" dialog with client selector, goal config, split/periodization
- Generation log tracking tokens, duration, retries
- Cost: ~$0.12-0.36 per generation

### 2.7 PWA Polish
- Service worker (`public/sw.js`): cache-first for static, stale-while-revalidate for API
- "Add to Home Screen" install prompt banner
- Pull-to-refresh gesture handler
- Skeleton loading states for all client pages

### 2.8 Workout Logging & Recommendations
- Interactive workout logging from `/client/workouts`
- Progressive overload algorithm (`lib/weight-recommendation.ts`):
  - Epley 1RM estimation
  - RPE-based progression (≤7 increase, 8 maintain, 9 hold, 10 decrease)
  - Intensity-percentage-based computation
  - Trend detection (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Expandable exercise cards with:
  - Recommended weight badges
  - Pre-filled log form (weight, sets, reps)
  - RPE slider (1-10)
  - Collapsible duration + notes fields
- AI Coach button → Claude analysis dialog (plateau detection, deload recommendations, key observations)
- Batch progress DAL function (avoids N+1 queries)

---

## Phase 3: Assessment Engine & AI Program Delivery — PLANNED

> Transforms the static questionnaire into a conditional assessment that identifies ability, auto-generates programs, and reassesses periodically.

**End-state vision:** Client signs up → completes conditional assessment → system determines ability level → AI auto-generates a personalized program pulling exercises matched to their level/equipment/goals → program is delivered weekly → after 4 weeks, reassessment triggers → AI adjusts difficulty based on logged performance + feedback → new program generated → cycle repeats.

```

### 3A — Exercise Categorization & Tagging

**Goal:** Every exercise gets a granular difficulty score and progression chain so AI can match exercises to client ability.

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE exercises
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS difficulty_score integer CHECK (difficulty_score >= 1 AND difficulty_score <= 10),
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS prerequisite_exercises uuid[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS progression_order integer;

UPDATE exercises SET difficulty_score = CASE
  WHEN difficulty = 'beginner' THEN 3
  WHEN difficulty = 'intermediate' THEN 6
  WHEN difficulty = 'advanced' THEN 9
  ELSE 5
END WHERE difficulty_score IS NULL;
```

**Difficulty Scale:**
| Score | Label | Who it's for | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1-2 | Foundational | Complete beginners, rehab | Bodyweight squat, wall push-up |
| 3-4 | Beginner | New to gym, < 6 months | Goblet squat, push-up, lat pulldown |
| 5-6 | Intermediate | 6 months - 2 years | Back squat, bench press, barbell row |
| 7-8 | Advanced | 2+ years, strong base | Bulgarian SS, weighted pull-up, front squat |
| 9-10 | Elite | Competitive athletes | Snatch, muscle-up, pistol squat |

**Admin UI:** Add difficulty slider (1-10), progression order, prerequisite selector to exercise form.

**Files:**
| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Migration | `supabase/migrations/00017_exercise_difficulty_scoring.sql` |
| Type | `types/database.ts` — add `difficulty_score`, `prerequisite_exercises`, `progression_order` |
| Validator | `lib/validators/exercise.ts` — add new fields |
| Admin UI | `components/admin/ExerciseFormDialog.tsx` — difficulty slider, prerequisites |
| Seed | `scripts/seed.ts` — update exercise data |

---

### 3B — Conditional Assessment Questionnaire

**Goal:** Replace static form with branching assessment that objectively determines ability per movement pattern — like a solar system selector where early answers determine follow-up questions.

**Assessment Flow:**
```
Section 1: Background & Goals (always shown)
  ├─ Training goals (multi-select)
  ├─ Sport (if sport_specific selected)
  └─ Available equipment (checkbox grid)

Section 2: Movement Screen (conditional branching)
  ├─ Squat: "Can you squat to parallel?"
  │   ├─ Yes → "Can you back squat your bodyweight?"
  │   │   ├─ Yes → "Can you squat 1.5x bodyweight?" → advanced/intermediate
  │   │   └─ No → beginner+
  │   └─ No → beginner
  │
  ├─ Push: "Can you do 5 push-ups?"
  │   ├─ Yes → "Can you bench your bodyweight?" → advanced/intermediate
  │   └─ No → beginner
  │
  ├─ Pull: "Can you do 1 strict pull-up?"
  │   ├─ Yes → "Can you do 10?" → advanced/intermediate
  │   └─ No → beginner
  │
  └─ Hinge: "Can you hip hinge with flat back?"
      ├─ Yes → "Can you deadlift your bodyweight?" → intermediate+/beginner+
      └─ No → beginner

Section 3: Training Context (always shown)
  ├─ Days per week, session duration
  └─ Injuries + injury detail builder

Section 4: Preferences (optional)
  └─ Likes, dislikes, notes

RESULT → Computed ability profile:
  ├─ Per-pattern levels (squat, push, pull, hinge)
  ├─ Overall level (beginner/intermediate/advanced/elite)
  └─ max_difficulty_score (drives exercise selection)
```

**Database:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE assessment_questions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  section text NOT NULL CHECK (section IN ('movement_screen', 'background', 'context', 'preferences')),
  movement_pattern text,
  question_text text NOT NULL,
  question_type text NOT NULL CHECK (question_type IN ('yes_no', 'single_select', 'multi_select', 'number', 'text')),
  options jsonb,
  parent_question_id uuid REFERENCES assessment_questions(id),
  parent_answer text,
  level_impact jsonb,
  order_index integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE assessment_results (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  assessment_type text NOT NULL CHECK (assessment_type IN ('initial', 'reassessment')),
  answers jsonb NOT NULL,
  computed_levels jsonb NOT NULL,
  max_difficulty_score integer NOT NULL,
  triggered_program_id uuid REFERENCES programs(id),
  completed_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Scoring:**
| Total Score | Level | Max Exercise Difficulty |
|-------------|-------|------------------------|
| 0-2 | Beginner | 1-4 |
| 3-5 | Intermediate | 4-7 |
| 6-8 | Advanced | 7-9 |
| 9+ | Elite | 8-10 |

**Files:**
| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Migration | `supabase/migrations/00018_assessment_engine.sql` |
| Types | `types/database.ts` — `AssessmentQuestion`, `AssessmentResult` |
| DAL | `lib/db/assessments.ts` — CRUD for questions + results |
| Validator | `lib/validators/assessment.ts` |
| Scoring | `lib/assessment-scoring.ts` — pure function: answers → levels |
| API | `app/api/assessment/questions/route.ts` — GET active questions |
| API | `app/api/assessment/submit/route.ts` — POST answers → compute → save |
| API | `app/api/admin/assessments/questions/route.ts` — admin CRUD |
| API | `app/api/admin/assessments/results/route.ts` — admin view results |
| Component | `components/client/AssessmentForm.tsx` — branching form UI |
| Component | `components/admin/AssessmentQuestionBuilder.tsx` — question editor |
| Page | `app/(client)/client/questionnaire/page.tsx` — swap to AssessmentForm |
| Page | `app/(admin)/admin/assessments/page.tsx` — question builder |

---

### 3C — Auto-Triggered AI Program Generation

**Goal:** Assessment completion auto-triggers AI program generation using ability levels to filter exercises.

**Flow:**
```
Client submits assessment
  → Compute ability levels (max_difficulty_score)
  → Save assessment_result
  → Call AI orchestrator with ability constraints
    → Agent 1 receives: client profile + assessment levels
    → Agent 3 filters: exercises WHERE difficulty_score <= max_difficulty_score
    → Agent 4 validates: no exercises above client's level
  → Program created + auto-assigned (status: active)
  → Client redirected to /client/workouts
```

**Changes to AI pipeline:**
- `lib/ai/orchestrator.ts` — accept `assessment_result` as input
- `lib/ai/exercise-context.ts` — filter by `difficulty_score`
- `lib/ai/prompts.ts` — Agent 1 + Agent 4 prompts include ability levels
- Add `generation_trigger` to `ai_generation_log`: `'admin_manual' | 'initial_assessment' | 'reassessment'`

**Auto-assignment:** Complete existing active assignment → create new one → send notification.

**Files:**
| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Modify | `lib/ai/orchestrator.ts`, `exercise-context.ts`, `prompts.ts` |
| Migration | `supabase/migrations/00019_generation_trigger.sql` |
| API | `app/api/assessment/submit/route.ts` — trigger generation after save |
| Component | `components/client/AssessmentForm.tsx` — add generation loading state |

---

### 3D — Weekly Progressive Programs

**Goal:** Track weekly progression within a program cycle. Client sees only the current week's exercises and advances after completing them.

**Database:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE program_assignments
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS current_week integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_weeks integer;
```

**Behavior:**
- Workouts page filters `program_exercises` by `week_number = assignment.current_week`
- "Complete Week" button appears when all exercises for the week are logged
- Advancing to next week shows progressively harder programming
- Progress page shows week-over-week history

**Files:**
| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Migration | `supabase/migrations/00020_assignment_week_tracking.sql` |
| Modify | `app/(client)/client/workouts/page.tsx` — filter by `current_week` |
| Modify | `lib/db/assignments.ts` — add `advanceWeek()` |
| API | `app/api/client/workouts/complete-week/route.ts` |
| Component | `components/client/WorkoutDay.tsx` — "Complete Week" button |

---

### 3E — Periodic Reassessment

**Goal:** After completing a program cycle (e.g., 4 weeks), prompt a shorter reassessment that adjusts difficulty based on 3 signals: client feedback, RPE data, and movement re-screen.

**Reassessment Form:**
```
Section 1: Performance Feedback
  ├─ "How did the program feel?" (too easy / just right / too hard)
  ├─ "Which exercises felt too easy?" (multi-select from their program)
  ├─ "Which exercises felt too hard?" (multi-select)
  └─ "Any new injuries?"

Section 2: Movement Re-Screen (only borderline patterns)
  └─ Re-test movements that were at beginner level

RESULT → Adjusted difficulty
```

**3-Signal Difficulty Adjustment:**
```
adjustment = 0
if feedback == "too_easy":  adjustment += 1
if avg_rpe < 6:             adjustment += 1   // workouts too light
if feedback == "too_hard":  adjustment -= 1
if avg_rpe > 9:             adjustment -= 1   // workouts too heavy
if movement_improved:       adjustment += 1

new_max_difficulty = clamp(old + adjustment, 1, 10)
```

**Database:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE assessment_results
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS previous_assessment_id uuid REFERENCES assessment_results(id),
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS feedback jsonb;
```

**Trigger:** When `current_week > total_weeks` → assignment status = completed → reassessment banner on dashboard.

**Files:**
| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Migration | `supabase/migrations/00021_reassessment_fields.sql` |
| Scoring | `lib/assessment-scoring.ts` — `computeReassessmentAdjustment()` |
| API | `app/api/assessment/reassess/route.ts` |
| Component | `components/client/ReassessmentForm.tsx` |
| Component | `components/client/ReassessmentBanner.tsx` |
| Page | `app/(client)/client/reassessment/page.tsx` |
| Modify | `app/(client)/client/dashboard/page.tsx` — check for pending reassessments |

---

**Features:**
1. **Assessment Question Builder** — CRUD, drag-and-drop ordering, branching logic, flow preview
2. **Client Assessment History** — timeline of all assessments per client, computed levels, generated programs, manual override
3. **Program Generation Log** — filter by trigger (manual / initial / reassessment)
4. **Exercise Progression Viewer** — progression chains per movement pattern, client positions
